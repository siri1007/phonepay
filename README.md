# phonepay



I have created a simple PhonePay project using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface inspired by popular mobile payment apps. The HTML structure includes different sections such as a header, navigation bar, payment options, and transaction history. 
Using CSS, I styled the elements to create a modern and responsive design, ensuring that the project looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Overall, this PhonePay project demonstrates my proficiency in using HTML for structuring web pages and CSS for styling.
